# Snakemake workflow for using the Microstructure Diffusion Toolbox (MDT)
This is a snakemake workflow for using the Microstructure Diffusion Toolbox (MDT - https://mdt-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest_release/index.html). It was designed to run microstrcuture modelling on unfolded hippocampal diffusion data (more about unfolding the hippocampus by @jordandekraker at https://github.com/jordandekraker/HippUnfolding).
